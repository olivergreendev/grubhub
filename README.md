# GrubHub

GrubHub is my third, and most proudest iOS piece of work. It was my final year project at University which partnered with a report, resulted in an A- grade.

GrubHub is an eCommerce application that enables users to choose a [participating] coffee shop within a certain radius, and place an order remotely.

The user may wish to place an order when they are 5 minutes away, should they be on a tight schedule. The user may instead wish to bypass an existing queue, and place an order while they are at their table.

GrubHub combats queues within coffee chains, and creates a seamless, yet manageable approach to ordering.
